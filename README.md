#### 1. First, create a histogram depicting the relative frequencies of the card values for a single draw. Report the mean, median, and standard deviation of the value distribution.

* This experiment will require the use of a standard deck of playing cards. This is a deck of fifty-two cards divided into four suits (spades (♠), hearts (♥), diamonds (♦), and clubs (♣)), each suit containing thirteen cards (Ace, numbers 2-10, and face cards Jack, Queen, and King).

* As you can see, values 1 to 9 has equal frequency(4), but the value 10 has much higher frequency(16).
* Features
  * **Mean:** 6.54  
  * **Median:** 7
  * **Standard Deviation(SD):** 3.15

#### 2. Take a look at the distribution of the three-card sums from the samples that you obtained from Generated Data. Report descriptive statistics for the samples you have drawn. Include at least two measures of central tendency and two measures of variability.

* **Generated Card Data (30 samples) -> Converted Value -> Avgerage (/3) :**  
(7h Kh 3d) -> 20 -> 6.67  
(Jd Kh 9d) -> 29 -> 9.67  
(2c Qs Jd) -> 22 -> 7.33  
(8h 8d 6c) -> 22 -> 7.33  
(Qs Kc 3h) -> 23 -> 7.67  
(4h Ac Qc) -> 24 -> 8  
(2s 9d Ad) -> 21 -> 7  
(9c 3d 8c) -> 20 -> 6.67  
(7h 7c Ac) -> 24 -> 8  
(7d Jc Qc) -> 27 -> 9  
(Kd 7d 3s) -> 20 -> 6.67  
(Jd 3h 10h) -> 23 -> 7.67  
(Jc 10d 10h) -> 30 -> 10  
(Qd 8d 3s) -> 21 -> 7  
(6s 9c 8c) -> 23 -> 7.67  
(4c 3s 6h) -> 13 -> 4.33  
(Ac 10h 5s) -> 25 -> 8.33  
(4s 4d Qs) -> 18 -> 6  
(4s Ks Jh) -> 24 -> 8  
(3c Qd 2c) -> 15 -> 5  
(Kh 5d Ac) -> 25 -> 8.33  
(2d 7s 5h) -> 14 -> 4.67  
(Ac 3c 10c) -> 23 -> 7.67  
(Jd Jc Ad) -> 30 -> 10  
(10d 5s 6s) -> 21 -> 7  
(2h 2d 6c) -> 10 -> 3.33  
(Kh 3d 6d) -> 19 -> 6.67  
(2c Jd 5c) -> 17 -> 5.67  
(5s 6h 9d) -> 20 -> 6.67  
(5s 10d 3h) -> 18 -> 6 


#### 3. Create a histogram of the sampled three-card sums. Compare its shape to that of the original distribution. How are they different, and can you explain why this is the case?

#### 4. Make some estimates about values you would get on future draws. Within what range will you expect approximately 90% of your draw values to fall? What is the approximate probability that you will get a draw value of at least 20? Make sure you justify how you obtained your values.
